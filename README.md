## Why did we build it?
EA has been criticised many times for their anti-consumer practices, including pricy lootboxes, numerous paid DLCs, and the pay-to-win nature of many of their games. We felt thatbarodying them would be an interesting and unique concept for a game.

## What are we prooud of?
It actually works TM

when 7 people in total couldn't troubleshoot one pesky modal
